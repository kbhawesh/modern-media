    <h1>Q3. What is web accessibility? List some of the assistive device which play a major role in providing accessibility.</h1>
    <h4>Web accessibility refers to the practice of ensuring that websites and web applications are usable by people with disabilities. This includes making sure that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites effectively.</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Some of the assistive devices that play a major role in providing accessibility for people with disabilities include</h3>
    <p>
        1. Screen readers: Screen readers are software programs that read out the text on a screen to a user who is blind or visually impaired. They convert text into speech or braille output, allowing users to navigate websites and interact with content.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Magnifiers: Magnification software helps users with low vision by enlarging text and images on the screen. This makes content easier to read and interact with for people with visual impairments.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Voice recognition software: Voice recognition software allows users to control a computer or device using voice commands. This is particularly helpful for people with mobility impairments who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Alternative input devices: Alternative input devices such as sip-and-puff devices, head pointers, and eye-tracking systems allow users with physical disabilities to interact with websites and applications using alternative methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Braille displays: Braille displays provide tactile output of digital content for users who are blind or visually impaired. They convert text into braille characters that can be read by touch.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Q4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.</h1>
    <p>
        1. Semantic HTML: Using semantic HTML elements such as (header), (nav), (main), (footer), (article), (section), and (aside) helps improve accessibility by providing clear structure and meaning to the content.
             Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to properly interpret and present the content to users with disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Alternative text for images: Adding descriptive alt text to images using the alt attribute in the (img) tag ensures that users who are visually impaired or using screen readers can 
        understand the purpose and context of the images on the website. This is crucial for providing a comprehensive and inclusive experience for all users.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Keyboard accessibility: Ensuring that all interactive elements on a website can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard is essential for users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device.
         This includes providing keyboard focus indicators, ensuring logical tab order, and allowing users to navigate and interact with all elements using keyboard shortcuts or commands.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>Q5. Write a short note on the tab index.</h1>
    <p>The tabindex attribute is used in HTML to specify the order in which elements receive focus when navigating through a webpage using the keyboard. By setting the tabindex value of an element, developers can control the 
        sequence in which users can navigate through interactive elements on a webpage using the "Tab" key.
        <br>
        The tabindex attribute accepts numerical values, with elements having a lower tabindex value receiving focus first. A tabindex value of 0 indicates that an element should be included in the default tab order based on its
         position in the HTML document. Negative values can also be used to exclude elements from the tab order.
        <br>
        It is important to use tabindex judiciously and ensure that the tab order follows a logical and intuitive sequence for users. Overriding the default tab order can sometimes lead to confusing or unpredictable navigation experiences for
         users, so it is recommended to use tabindex sparingly and in conjunction with other accessibility
         best practices to create a more inclusive user experience.</p>

    <h1>Q6. List any 5 semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions.</h1>
        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>
            The (header) tag represents the introductory content or a group of navigational links at the top of a webpage. It typically contains headings, logos, navigation menus, search bars, and other elements that provide context or aid in website navigation.
        </p>
        <h3>main</h3>
        <p>
            The (main) tag defines the main content area of a webpage. It should contain the primary content of the page, such as articles, blog posts, product listings, or any other central information that is unique to that specific webpage.
        </p>
        <h3>nav</h3>
        <p>
            The (nav) tag is used to define a section of a webpage that contains navigation links. It is typically used to group together links that lead to different parts of the website or external pages, helping users easily navigate through the site.
        </p>
        <h3>article</h3>
        <p>
            The (article) tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content within a webpage. It represents content that is independently distributable or reusable, such as blog posts, news articles, forum posts, or user comments.

        </p>
        <h3>footer</h3>
        <p>
            The (footer) tag represents the footer section of a webpage, typically located at the bottom. It often contains copyright information, contact details, sitemap links, social media icons, and other elements that provide additional information about the website or help users navigate away from the page.

        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h1>Q7. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our webpage.</h1>
        <p>
            1. <b>Improved Accessibility:</b> Semantic tags provide structure and meaning to the content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret and present the information to users with disabilities. This helps ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and understand the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <b>Better SEO:</b> Search engines like Google and Bing rely on semantic HTML to understand the content and context of a webpage. By using semantic tags appropriately, you can help search engines better index and rank your content, potentially improving your website's visibility in search results.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <b>Enhanced User Experience:</b> Semantic tags make it easier for users to navigate and interact with your website. Clear and well-defined sections like headers, navigation menus, main content areas, and footers help users quickly find the information they are looking for, leading to a more positive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <b>Consistent Styling:</b> Semantic tags provide a standardized way to structure web content, making it easier to apply consistent styling across different pages of a website. This can help maintain a cohesive design and branding throughout the site.

        </p>
        <p>
            5. <b>Future Compatibility:</b> Semantic HTML is designed to be forward-compatible with new technologies and devices. By using semantic tags, you can ensure that your website remains accessible and functional across various platforms and devices, including mobile devices, voice assistants, and emerging technologies.
