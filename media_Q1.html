    <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML defines the structure and content of a web page by using a system of tags and attributes. These tags define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML is the foundation of any website and is used in conjunction 
        with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.
